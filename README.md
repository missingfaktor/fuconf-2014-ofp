## Object-Functional Programming - A Beautiful Unification or a Kitchen Sink?

These are the slides from my talk at [Functional Conf, 2014](functionalconf.com). The talk was recorded, and the video will be uploaded very soon.

The `.key` file has presenter notes, but the `.pdf` doesn't. Presenter notes contain links to various papers and talks I referred to in my talk.
